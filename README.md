# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

AS A bootcamp student was tasked to design and deploy a porfolio of work samples SO THAT it can be review by a future employor to be consider for a candidate.

While work on the challenges it ran different tests of layouts for the website. During the builded I learn to work on different sections of my web from top to bottom starting with building the html foundation laying out your sections to work with css. Working on module-02 could't get my flexbox to come out the way I wanted, I went back and forth looking to differnt videos and examples provided. Thats when I came to realization that my html was not nested correctly in between there parent and child elements for my flexbox to work. I was even testing how to create layouts using grid. Also in this module it challenged me to look into different ways to create layouts and making your page more unique using css.
